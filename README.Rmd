NetworkDistance package is a collection of **inter-graph** distance measures. Instead of graph distance that measures 
the degree of farness between nodes within a graph, we consider each network as an object and compute distance between those objects. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of NetworkDistance from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("NetworkDistance")
```
or the development version from github:
```r
## install.packages("devtools")
## library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("kyoustat/NetworkDistance")
```

## Currently Available Methods
We support following methds at this stage and the collection will be expanded continuously.
