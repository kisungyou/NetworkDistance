\title{Distance Measures for Networks}
\description{
Network has gathered much attention from many disciplines, as many of real data
can be well represented in the relational form. The concept of distance - or, metric - between
two networks is the starting point for inference on population of networks. \pkg{NetworkDistance} package
provides a not-so-comprehensive collection of distance measures for measuring dissimilarity between two network objects.
Data should be supplied as \emph{adjacency} matrices, where we support three formats of data representation;
\code{matrix} object in \pkg{R} base, \code{network} class from \pkg{network} package, and \code{igraph} class from
\pkg{igraph} package.
